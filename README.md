# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Classifier and Treatment Advisory using Machine Learning Techniques

This project is a machine learning-based web application that classifies plant leaf diseases from uploaded images and provides treatment suggestions. It is designed to assist farmers, agronomists, and researchers in identifying plant health issues early and recommending effective treatment options.

## 🚀 How to Run the App Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-leaf-disease-classifier.git

Install required packages
 pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app
 streamlit run main.py

🌱 Sample Usage
Upload an image of a diseased plant leaf.

The model will predict the disease (e.g., Apple Cedar Rust).

Based on the prediction, the app will suggest a treatment (e.g., Apply sulfur-based fungicide).

📷 Dataset Information
The model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 50,000+ labeled leaf images across various plant species and diseases.

🤖 Model Overview
Model Type: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Accuracy Achieved: ~95% on validation data

💊 Treatment Logic
The app uses a dictionary-based lookup system to recommend treatments based on the classified disease. Each disease is mapped to:
